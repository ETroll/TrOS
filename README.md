# TrollOS
The result of a long weekly commute to a consulting gig. I was bored on the train and needed something to learn and code.

> We choose to develop our own operating system and do the other things, not because they are easy but because they are hard.

### TrOS-1
First "iteration" of the system. Developed for the Raspberry Pi 2. Only bare minimal working system. Got replaced with TrOS-2

### TrOS-2
Current "iteration" of the system. This is currently under development.

## Tooling
The custom build tooling used to create the image used with qemu requires
OSX 10.9 and above. And the GO runtime installed.
