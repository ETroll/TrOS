# Simple Rasbpootin compatable "terminal"

This is a simple tool I built just to be able to use Raspbootin from my windows machine. I found it wasier to just develop this primitive .NET tool instead
of porting the raspbootin tool itself to Windows.

It is basically just a program that sends the kernel when asked for it, and displays all other serial output to a textbox in the application. There have 
been made no effort to emulate any type of terminal.
