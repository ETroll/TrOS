### Trell

Trell is the primary shell that is used in TrOS-2.

I often get told that I am one of those who most often comes with the remark
"In the old days..." when software development is discussed today. So this is
why when I am creating a shell for TrOS-2 I chose to go with plan 25x80 VGA.

So back to the 80's! My goal with Trell is to create the shell I would have loved
to use myself back in the 80's or early 90's.
